You learn by doing. The only way to get better at programming is to actually program. Donâ€™t let an analysis paralysis prevent you from ever starting.


Letting problems pile up without checking is a poor strategy. I used to make endless changes to my code and expect it to work right away. The problem with this approach is that it stacks one problem on top of another, and it becomes difficult to figure what went wrong.
